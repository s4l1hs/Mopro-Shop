# Trendyol Parity Audit — Search

> **Audit only — no code.** Self-audit of the Search surface (bar + entry points,
> suggestions/autocomplete, query results page, no-results) against a
> **provisional** Trendyol baseline. `/sr` is bot-blocked (403) → **no markup for
> Trendyol search**; this leans on the impl self-audit (`src`) + Salih's live
> walk. Sibling of `TRENDYOL_PARITY_PLP_AUDIT.md`; findings use the #09 format,
> IDs **SE-NN**.
>
> **Surface (source):** `SearchScreen` (`lib/features/catalog/screens/
> search_screen.dart`) · `searchProvider` · `recent_searches_provider` ·
> `SearchInput` · `web_search_pill` + `SearchSuggestionsDropdown` (desktop header)
> · `header_search_bar` · backend `SearchProductsSummary`. The results page reuses
> the PLP substrate (`CatalogShell` · `FilterPanel` · `PlpFilterChips` · `sort` ·
> `plpFiltersProvider(plpKeyForSearch(q))`).

## §0 — Legend

- **Source** — `src` (Mopro code fact) · `walk` (Salih, search-specific/visual).
  *No `markup` row — Trendyol `/sr` is 403.*
- **Confidence** — **CONFIRMED** (structural source fact) · **PROBABLE**
  (search-specific / visual — awaits the walk) · **NOT-ACTIONABLE** (intentional).

---

## §1 — Summary

- **PLP-inheritance: PARTIAL** (the headline — see §2). Shared *widgets* carry
  over; the **screen-level** PLP improvements do **not**, because `SearchScreen`
  reimplements the results wiring separately from `CategoryProductsScreen`.
- **CONFIRMED search-specific deltas (src): 7** — SE-02 (mobile search has **no
  filter** affordance), SE-03 (no result count), SE-04 (load-more, no infinite-
  scroll/numbered-pages), SE-05 (flat breakpoints), **~~SE-06~~ ✅ RESOLVED**
  (`feat/search-suggestions-se06`): `/search/suggest` now returns structured
  `SuggestResponse{brands, products}` (`catalog.Suggest` → `SuggestBrands` +
  `SearchProductsSummary`, §5-safe) and the dropdown renders brand + product
  (as-you-type) rows, SE-07 (no "did you mean"/no-results recovery), SE-09 (mobile
  empty lacks trending).
- **PROBABLE → resolved source-side** (`feat/search-probable-resolution`, no walk; `docs/internal/search-probable-resolution.md`): **SE-08** relevance ranking → **CONFIRMED ✅ FIXED** (`SearchProducts` now `ORDER BY ts_rank(...) DESC, p.id ASC` — discovery shift: it was id-ordered on `main`, *not* already done). **SE-10**: sponsored results → **NOT-ACTIONABLE** (no ads model, settled); search-within refine box → **NEEDS-DECISION** (product).
- ~~**PROBABLE (await walk): 2**~~ (original) — SE-08 (relevance ranking), SE-10 (search-within /
  sponsored).
- **NOT-ACTIONABLE: 4** — no camera (HP-04 dropped), no sponsored ads (no ads
  model), cashback chip on cards, brand-orange tokens.
- **Already-matched: ~8** (§5). **Seed:** local search **exercisable** (§6).

## §2 — PLP-inheritance check (the key §1.1 deliverable)

`SearchScreen` reuses the PLP **components** but has its **own** `_results`/`_shell`
wiring → it did **not** pick up the recent per-screen PLP fixes:

| PLP item | Inherited by search? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Grid (`ProductGrid` via `CatalogShell`) | ✅ yes | shared shell |
| Desktop filter sidebar (`FilterPanel`, no category tree) | ✅ yes | mounted in `_results` |
| Applied chips (`PlpFilterChips`, desktop) | ✅ yes | mounted in `_results` |
| Sort (`PlpSort` + sort sheet/dropdown) | ✅ yes | wired |
| **PLP-20** sticky sort/filter bar | ✅ yes | lives in the shared `CatalogShell` |
| **PLP-18** sticky desktop sidebar | ✅ yes | same height-bounded column layout |
| Empty / error states | ✅ yes | shared shell |
| **PLP-04** result count | ❌ **no** | `SearchState` has no `total`; `_shell` passes no count → **SE-03** |
| **PLP-03 / PLP-15** infinite scroll / numbered pages | ❌ **no** | `_shell` uses `onLoadMore` (load-more) on **all** breakpoints → **SE-04** |
| **PLP-19** ultra-wide breakpoints (2/3/4/5) | ❌ **no** | search uses flat `wide ? (5/3) : 2` → **SE-05** |
| Mobile filter sheet (PLP-01) | ❌ **no** | `_shell` sets `onSort` but **not** `onFilter` on mobile → **SE-02** (mobile search can't filter at all) |
| **PLP-12** subtree rollup | n/a | search isn't single-category scoped |

> **Discovery shift:** "inherited from PLP" is only true for the *shared widgets*.
> The screen-level wins (count, pagination model, breakpoints, mobile filtering)
> need to be **ported** to `SearchScreen` — they're the same fixes, not new work.
> Cleanest long-term: factor the PLP/search results body into one shared screen.

## §3 — Search-specific findings (registry)

| ID | Finding (Mopro current → Trendyol) | Source | Confidence | Sev |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SE-01** | PLP-inheritance is **partial** (shared widgets only; screen-level wiring not ported) — see §2 | src | **CONFIRMED** | — |

| **SE-10** | No "search within results" refine box; no sponsored results | src | **PROBABLE** | LOW |

> Search-bar mic, exact suggestion styling, relevance quality, and no-results copy
> are **visual/behavioural** → confirm in the walk (§7).

---

## §4 — Intentional divergences (NOT-ACTIONABLE — do not flag)

- **D1 — No camera / visual-search** in the search bar (HP-04 deliberately dropped).
- **D2 — No sponsored / ad results** (Mopro has no ads model).
- **D3 — Cashback chip** on result cards (Mopro perpetual-cashback model).
- **D4 — Brand-orange tokens** on active suggestions/filters.

---

## §5 — Already-matched (VERIFIED from source)

Search bar + entry points (desktop header `WebSearchPill`, mobile home pill →
`/search`) · **recent-search persistence** (`recentSearchesProvider`: chips,
removable, clear-all) · **trending** queries (desktop dropdown) · **category**
suggestions (dropdown + mobile empty) · the **PLP grid + desktop filters + chips +
sort + sticky bar** (inherited shared widgets, §2) · empty/error states · query
echo (mobile AppBar input; desktop a query Chip) · debounced (300 ms) query.

---

## §6 — Seed / index adequacy

Local search is **exercisable**: title/`search_vector`/brand matching over the
seed returns results — `nike` → 6, `ayakkab` → 2, `iphone`/`apple` → 6. The walk
can drive real queries. (Note: results aren't relevance-ranked — SE-08.)

---

## §7 — Walk-findings slots (Salih — search-specific; #09 format)

> The search-specific bits need your eyes: suggestion completeness, no-results
> recovery, relevance quality, mic. Paste observations; flip PROBABLE → CONFIRMED
> + severity (or NOT-ACTIONABLE). New items continue at **SE-11+**.

```
### SE-NN — <one-line title>
- **Surface/region:** Search › <bar | suggestions dropdown | results grid | no-results | empty>
- **Trendyol (live):** <observation>  [walk date: ____]
- **Mopro (current):** <file:line if known>
- **Delta / Status / Severity / Notes>
```

<!-- SE-06 — confirm Trendyol's autocomplete shows brand + product suggestions. -->
<!-- SE-07 — confirm Trendyol's no-results: "did you mean" + popular alternatives. -->
<!-- SE-08 — confirm Trendyol's default is relevance-ranked. -->
<!-- SE-11 … -->

## §8 — Prioritized fix list (after the walk)

1. **Port the screen-level PLP wins to `SearchScreen`** (SE-02/03/04/05) — same
   fixes already shipped for the PLP: **mobile filter sheet** (SE-02, the real
   gap), **result count**, **infinite-scroll/numbered-pages**, **2/3/4/5
   breakpoints**. *Cheapest path: extract a shared results body.*
2. ~~**SE-06** — brand + product (as-you-type) suggestions in the dropdown.~~ **✅ SHIPPED (`feat/search-suggestions-se06`):** `/search/suggest` → `SuggestResponse{brands, products}` + the dropdown brand/product rows.
3. **SE-07** — no-results recovery ("did you mean" + popular alternatives).
4. **SE-08** — relevance default sort (backend ts_rank) — confirm + backend track.
5. **SE-09 / SE-10** — trending on mobile empty; refine box. LOW.

> Severities provisional until the walk. **PLP findings that auto-apply to
> search:** PLP-20 (sticky bar) ✅ already; PLP-13/14 (attribute / price-history
> facets) would surface in the shared `FilterPanel` → search inherits them when
> built. No fixes in this PR.
